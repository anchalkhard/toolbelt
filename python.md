> Hereâ€™s my comprehensive list to ensure a thorough roadmap for understanding Python. Iâ€™ve tried to ensure no stone is left unturned, However this is just a begining ðŸ¥¹ [^1]
---

## Core Python Concepts:

- [ ] Python Data Types (int, float, str, list, tuple, dict, set, etc.)

- [ ] Mutable vs Immutable Types

- [ ] Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment, Bitwise, Identity, Membership)

- [ ] Python's Scoping Rules (LEGB: Local, Enclosed, Global, Built-in)

- [ ] Type Hinting and Annotations (typing module)

- [ ] Control Flow (if, elif, else, loops, break/continue/pass)

- [ ] Exception Handling (try/except, raise, finally, custom exceptions)

---

## Functions & Functional Programming:

- [ ] Functions (definitions, parameters, return values)

- [ ] *args and **kwargs (advanced parameter handling)

- [ ] Lambda Functions

- [ ] Closures and Scope

- [ ] Decorators (regular and parameterized decorators)

- [ ] Difference between Decorators and Closures

- [ ] Can Decorators Be Used for a Class?

- [ ] Higher-Order Functions (map, filter, reduce from functools)

- [ ] List/Dict/Set Comprehensions and Generator Expressions

- [ ] Partial Functions (functools.partial)

---

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

- [ ] Classes and Objects (creation, attributes, methods)

- [ ] Inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical)

- [ ] Polymorphism (method overloading and overriding)

- [ ] Abstract Classes (abc module)

- [ ] Properties with @property Decorator

- [ ] Metaclasses and Customizing Class Creation (type, __new__)

- [ ] All Dunder Methods (e.g., __init__, __repr__, __call__, __getitem__, etc.)

- [ ] Object Comparisons (__eq__, __lt__, etc.)

- [ ] Dynamic Attributes (__getattr__, __setattr__, __delattr__)

- [ ] Monkey Patching

---

## Advanced Features:

- [ ] Introspection (dir(), getattr(), setattr(), hasattr())

- [ ] Dynamic Code Execution (eval, exec)

- [ ] Python Memory Management and Garbage Collection (gc module)

- [ ] Handling Circular References

- [ ] Python Internals (bytecode, object model, stack frames)

---

## Concurrency and Parallelism:

- [ ] Threading and its Internals (threading module)

- [ ] Process vs Threads: Differences and Use Cases

- [ ] Thread Synchronization (Locks, Semaphores, Conditions)

- [ ] Multiprocessing and its Internals (multiprocessing module)

- [ ] Process Pooling (multiprocessing.Pool)

- [ ] asyncio (event loop, tasks, coroutines)

- [ ] Asynchronous Generators and Context Managers

- [ ] Task Scheduling (asyncio.Queue, asyncio.gather, etc.)

---

## Generators:

- [ ] Understanding Generators

- [ ] Yield and Yield From

- [ ] Memory-Efficiency with Generators

- [ ] Practical Use Cases of Generators (e.g., infinite sequences)

---

## File Handling & Context Managers:

- [ ] File Handling (read, write, append, modes, binary files)

- [ ] Using Files with Context Managers (with statement)

- [ ] Implementing Custom Context Managers (__enter__, __exit__)

- [ ] Temporary Files (tempfile module)

- [ ] File Encoding/Decoding (Unicode, UTF-8, etc.)

- [ ] Interaction with OS (os, shutil, pathlib modules)

- [ ] Modules, Packages, and Libraries:

- [ ]  Module Import Mechanics (import, from, as)

- [ ] Creating and Structuring Packages

- [ ] Understanding __init__.py

- [ ] Dynamic Imports (importlib)

- [ ] Python Standard Libraries (e.g., collections, itertools, functools)

- [ ] Using Virtual Environments (venv, virtualenv)

- [ ] Dependency Management (pip, poetry, conda)

---

## Data Serialization and Processing:

- [ ]  Data Parsing (XML, JSON, YAML; xml, json, pyyaml)

- [ ] Data Serialization and Deserialization (Pickle, MsgPack)

- [ ] Data Compression (gzip, bz2, zipfile, tarfile)

---

## Debugging and Profiling:

- [ ] Using pdb Debugger

- [ ] Performance Optimization (timeit, profile, cProfile)

- [ ] Tracing Code Execution (trace module)

---

## Testing:

- [ ] Unit Testing (unittest, pytest)

- [ ] Mocking Objects (unittest.mock)

- [ ] Automated Testing Tools (tox, pytest plugins)

- [ ] Test-Driven Development (TDD)

---

## Advanced Patterns and Practices:

- [ ] Design Patterns in Python (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)

- [ ] Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)

- [ ] Context-Specific Decorators

- [ ] Implementing Custom Iterators

- [ ] Dependency Injection in Python

- [ ] Fluent Interfaces

- [ ] Command Pattern and Callables (__call__)

---

## Extending Python:

- [ ] Writing Python Extensions in C/Cython

- [ ] Python-C API

- [ ] Using ctypes for Foreign Function Interface

- [ ] Interfacing with C++ (pybind11)

- [ ] Running Python Code from C or Embedding Python

---

## Miscellaneous Topics:

- [ ] Python for Web Development (flask, django, fastapi)

- [ ] Web Scraping (requests, beautifulsoup, scrapy)

- [ ] Working with APIs (REST, GraphQL)

- [ ] Data Science and Visualization (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)

- [ ] Machine Learning Frameworks (scikit-learn, tensorflow, pytorch)

- [ ] Database Interaction (sqlite3, sqlalchemy, ORMs)

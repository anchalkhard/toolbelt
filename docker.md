> A comprehensive list for thorough roadmap for understanding Docker concepts. [^1]

##  Core Docker Concepts:
- [ ] What is Docker? (containers vs. virtual machines)
- [ ] Installing Docker (Docker Desktop, Docker Engine)
- [ ] Docker CLI Basics (docker run, docker stop, docker rm, etc.)
- [ ] Docker Images (building, pulling, tagging)
- [ ] Docker Containers (creating, managing, stopping)
- [ ] Understanding Layers in Docker Images
- [ ] Docker Hub (exploring repositories, pushing/pulling images)
- [ ] Writing Dockerfiles (structure, commands like FROM, RUN, CMD)
- [ ] Networking Basics (bridge network, host network, port mapping)

## Advanced Docker Concepts:
- [ ] Multi-Stage Builds
- [ ] Optimizing Docker Images (reducing image size)
- [ ] Container Logs (docker logs, understanding outputs)
- [ ] Volumes and Persistent Storage
- [ ] Bind Mounts vs. Volumes
- [ ] Container Networking (network modes, custom networks)
- [ ] Docker Compose (defining services, using docker-compose.yml)
- [ ] Secrets and Configuration Management

## Docker Ecosystem:
- [ ] Docker Registry and Repository (public vs. private registries)
- [ ] Docker Swarm (orchestration basics, creating a swarm)
- [ ] Scaling Containers with Swarm
- [ ] Docker Stack and Stack Deployments
- [ ] Comparing Docker Swarm with Kubernetes
- [ ] Using Docker Extensions (plugins for monitoring, logging)

## Troubleshooting and Debugging:
- [ ] Debugging a Container (docker exec, inspecting files)
- [ ] Inspecting Container and Image Metadata
- [ ] Solving Image and Build Issues
- [ ] Monitoring Containers (docker stats, third-party tools)
- [ ] Dealing with "Zombie Containers"

## Security in Docker:
- [ ] Best Practices for Writing Secure Dockerfiles
- [ ] Minimizing the Attack Surface (using slim images)
- [ ] User Management in Containers (non-root users)
- [ ] Scanning Images for Vulnerabilities (docker scan, external tools)
- [ ] Understanding and Using Security Contexts

## Container Orchestration and Beyond:
- [ ] Introduction to Orchestration Tools (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- [ ] Kubernetes Basics (pods, services, deployments, and YAML files)
- [ ] CI/CD Pipelines with Docker (tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Docker and Infrastructure as Code (using Terraform, Ansible)

## Miscellaneous Topics:
- [ ] Using Docker with Python, Java, Node.js, etc.
- [ ] Containerizing Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Using Docker for Machine Learning and Data Science Workloads
- [ ] Migrating Legacy Applications to Docker
- [ ] Exploring Popular Docker Images (nginx, redis, etc.)
- [ ] Docker Alternatives (Podman, CRI-O)
- [ ] The Future of Containers and Docker
